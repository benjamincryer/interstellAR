University group project. Reuploading here, since I lost access to the original uni Gitlab

Note: Android build isn't functional due to our shift in development direction after the pandemic hit, since testing a social game involving close contact became infeasible.

Features:
Multiplayer, with up to 4 players (first to join acts as host)
Players each start with a Space Station, and lose when it is destroyed
Randomly generated planets types, resource amounts and galaxy layout
Planet capturing
Resource generation based on attributes of captured planets
Ship building: 3 types of ship, built by spending resources
Ship selection and grouping
Fleet combat, using a Rock-Paper-Scissors style system to determine which ships are strongest against others
